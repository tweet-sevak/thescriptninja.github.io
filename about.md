## _Greetings!_

Welcome to my blog, or as I like to think of it - my thought repo. Here you can find the footprints of the wanderings of my thoughts, useful stuff I have learnt and maybe some random rants about random things.


## About Me

I am 19 year old male Homo Sapien and a proud resident of Earth. I am supposed to be studying Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur (I know, I am smart bruh), but I spend most of my time either feverishly coding or privately snickering at memes on Facebook. Apart from this, I am a sworn bibliophile- I read _a lot_, I (try to) write poems and short stories which you can find [here](https://medium.com/@parthparadkar), and play the drums (no jokes here- music is sacred). I am huge MCU fan, love Maroon5, Post Malone and Drake, and _have never watched an episode of Game of Thrones_.
