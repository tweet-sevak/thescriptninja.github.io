## _Greetings!_

Welcome to my blog, or as I like to think of it - my thought repo. Here you can find the footprints of the wanderings of my thoughts, useful stuff I have learnt and maybe some random rants about random things.


## About Me

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thescriptninja/thescriptninja.github.io/master/img/profilepic.jpg" alt="Me" title="This is me" width="200" height="200" align="right"/>

I am a 19-year-old Homo Sapien and a proud resident of Earth. I study Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, but I spend most of my time either feverishly coding or privately snickering at memes on Facebook. Apart from this, I am a sworn bibliophile- I read _a lot_, I (try to) write poems and short stories which you can find [here](https://medium.com/@parthparadkar), and play the drums (no jokes here- music is sacred). I am huge MCU fan, love Maroon5, Post Malone and Drake, and _have never watched an episode of Game of Thrones_.
