As another year at college begins with all its feverish energy and stress, I am compelled to reminisce about the beautiful quagmire of open source programming I found myself in about a year ago. I remember the time I started learning C as a part of my first year course. It was not my first experience in programming but all I had done before that was HTML and I will go out on a limb here to say that it was not really programming (sorry frontend guys). I was not especially fond of it until I created a project of my own. I created a program to help me plot graphs in my physics lab in C and ever since then I have been hooked to programming. I guess the dopamine rush of creating something of use for myself and possibly for others usinng the knowledge I had gained was all it took.

A part of the course work was reading code written on paper and finding errors, completing missing code and predicting the output. As a happily naive newbie, I thought this was only a test of knowledge and won't be useful in real life. _Sighhhh_, I was SO wrong. Got an eye-opener as soon as I found out what contributing to open source software actually meant.

I then began hearing about GitHub and was fascinated by it without really knowing what it actually was. I was also aware of the prevalent competetive coding culture on campus,rankings, how it helped in placements, etc. I was not as interested in it as I was in creating my own projects. I had always wanted to create something of value, something that made a difference and open source programming enabled me to do exactly that.

I soon found about people doing open source on campus, the many useful projects they had created and was inspired to follow in their footsteps while crafting a path of my own at the same time.

I made my first GitHub repo after tons of trials and lots of Googling to store the C code for the plotting program I wrote. Now it seems so ridiculously easy though :grin: . I started learning Python after C as it was the 'in thing' and I was hearing a lot of good stuff about how easy and versatile the language was. I gradually fell in love with the language and started creating small projects. It will suffice to say that I will never even come near to completely mastering Python but _koshish jaari hai_. I progressed to learning Javascript, NodeJS, MonogDB, ReactJS, Redis, Shell scripting. I had a lot of fun building web applications with the MERN stack, scripts to automate tasks and Slack and Twitter bots.

As I started interacting with people with similar interests in programming, I realised they knew so much more than I did. They already knew three languages when I was just learning my second. Some people had started coding even before high school. They were building stuff even before I had written by first "Hello world". It was worrying at first, but then I realized it was going to be like that anywhere I went. There will always be people better than me wherever I go. I had faced the same during at school and during my coaching days. It is just a fact of life, I guess.

I have faced many embarassing situations this year, where I said something that was out of context or just plain wrong in conversations related to tech. I have found myself in embarassing silences when people around me spoke about things I had never even heard of. However I now realize that I learned the most exactly during those conversations. Slights to my self-esteem don't feel less painful when I think about the things I learned through those very experiences. I googled the things I had overheard when I got back to my room and learned something new each time. Although I never look forward to these situations, I do feel less awkward and embarassed nowadays. I realise that I am less forgiving to people's mistakes and ignorance, even in general everyday life since I have made so many mistakes and have been ignorant so many times.

These days, it feels strange when friends ask me stuff about programming since I am the 'coder' guy - How to setup Ubuntu? Where to start with Python? What is Github? I have so much yet to learn, so much left to do that I feel odd when someone thinks I am knowledgable enough to be approached with these doubts. It is of course a privilege.

Another exciting, stressful, roller-coaster year stretches before me with all its stress, work and fun. I don't know what awaits me but I guess it is best to assume the ship is unsinkable even while doing our best to sail through iceberg-infested waters :wink:

Peace out :v:
