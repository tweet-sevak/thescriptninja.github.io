For the past year or so, I have been absolutely obsessed with Russian Literature. I had never heard of any Russian authors before, only a few classics like 'War and Peace'.

My discovery of Russian Literature was in the most weird way. I was looking through the list of available books behind a Sherlock Holmes book and I stumbled upon a name - 'The Idiot' by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I found both, the name of the book and that of the author intriguing. What sort of a book is named 'The Idiot'? It should be mentioned that I was looking to read different genres of literature for a while now. I wanted to get out of the Dan Brown, Jeffrey Archer genre and explore what else was there to read.

So, I started to read about Dostoyevsky and finally started reading 'Crime and Punishment'. The book explores the guilt of a man who has commited a pointless murder and how this very guilt strangles and suffocates him. The plot sounds depressing and it very rightly is. I was put into a dark mood for a while after reading the book, since it delves deeply in philosophy and the human condition. However, I thoroughly was engrossed in reading the book. The imagery was amazing and the description of human emotions and thoughts was unlike anything I had ever read.


The next book I picked up was 'Anna Karenina' by Leo Tolstoy and lived upto its reputation as one of the best novels of all time. Set in pre-revolution Russia, it is the story of an extra-marital affair of a woman with a younger man. In the character of Levin, Tolstoy paints a compelling self-portrait. Once you start reading the book, it will engulf you in its world, it people, its times- the elaborate balls and operas, the horse-drawn carriages and snowy train stations. Although a bit lengthy, it is worth a read.

I noticed subtle differences in the style of the two authors. While Dostoyevsky seemed to be a bit more direct and confronting to the matter being presented, Tolstoy's prose is poetic, rich with metaphors and emotion. Dostoyevsky seems to be more skillful and intent on describing the person's state of mind. The intense guilt and desires experienced by Raskolnikov, the main character in 'Crime and Punishment' are heart-breaking. You are almost compelled to empathize with the character, despite his portrayal as a murederer. Both describe different classes of the Russian society, which is reflective of their upbringing. While Dostoyevsky describes the lower class- the beggars, starving scholars, prostitutes struggling in the streets, Tolstoy writes mostly about the upper class- the princes, counts, and the ladies waltzing in balls and receptions. However, both in their own way, paint a poignant picture of the people and the times of Russia.

After 'Anna Karenina', I tried reading 'The Brothers Karamazov' but was dissapointed with the heavy philosophical discussions that take place between the characters. I am still intent on reading the book. maybe I'll pick it up some other time

I am currently reading 'War and Peace', the classic tome by Tolstoy. It was on my wishlist for a long time and it feels great to finally check it off. Although the sheer size is quite intimidating, I am confident that I will complete it. 

On my wishlist currently are the following books:
1. Notes from Underground by Dostoyevsy
2. The Death of Ivan Ilych by Tolstoy
3. The Idiot by Dostoyevsy
4. Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev
